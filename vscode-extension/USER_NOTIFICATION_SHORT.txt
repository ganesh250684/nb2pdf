📢 **Quick Fix for nb2pdf Extension Error**

Hey everyone! If you're getting this error when using the nb2pdf extension:
❌ *"nb2pdf.py script error! Please reinstall the extension"*

**DON'T REINSTALL!** Just run this command instead:

```
pip install reportlab
```

Then reload VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Reload Window") and try again! ✅

---

**Why this happens:**
The extension needs a Python library called "reportlab" to create PDFs, but it wasn't installed on your system.

**Good news!** I've already published an updated version (v1.1.0) that:
- Checks for reportlab BEFORE converting
- Shows a clear error message
- Offers an "Install Now" button
- Provides step-by-step installation guide

**To get the update:**
Open Extensions in VS Code → Search "nb2pdf" → Click "Update"

---

**Still not working?**
Try these alternatives:
```
python -m pip install reportlab
```
OR
```
pip install --user reportlab
```
